1. Scripts within a folder designated "Final" indicates that these scripts are final and these are the versions to be used moving forward.
2. Scripts within a folder designated "Working" indicates that these scripts are drafts and they may be used for step wise ieration of the pipeline or for examining isolated steps.

- All scripts are commented with detail especially within the "Final folders"
- Within the Final_Full pipeline scripts folder ther is a batch file (run-multiple_sgRNAsver2.py) and then the assocaited method file (picksgRNAstoprimersver2.py). Additionally there is a script (compileprimers.py) to get the final primers from each folder and compile them into one excel spread sheet
